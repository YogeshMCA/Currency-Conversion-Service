@LoadBalanced
Used as a marker annotation indicating that the annotated RestTemplate should use a RibbonLoadBalancerClient for interacting with your service(s).

In turn, this allows you to use "logical identifiers" for the URLs you pass to the RestTemplate. These logical identifiers are typically the name of a service. 

For example:

restTemplate.getForObject("http://some-service-name/user/{id}", String.class, 1);
where some-service-name is the logical identifier.

@RibbonClient
Used for configuring your Ribbon client(s).

Is @RibbonClient required?

No! If you're using Service Discovery and you're ok with all of the default Ribbon settings, you don't even need to use the @RibbonClient annotation.

When should I use @RibbonClient?

There are at least two cases where you need to use @RibbonClient

You need to customize your Ribbon settings for a particular Ribbon client
You're not using any service discovery
Customizing your Ribbon settings:

Define a @RibbonClient

@RibbonClient(name = "some-service", configuration = SomeServiceConfig.class)
name - set it to the same name of the service you're calling with Ribbon but need additional customizations for how Ribbon interacts with that service.
configuration - set it to an @Configuration class with all of your customizations defined as @Beans. Make sure this class is not picked up by @ComponentScan otherwise it will override the defaults for ALL Ribbon clients.
